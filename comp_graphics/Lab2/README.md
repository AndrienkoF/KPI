# Lab №2
#### **Topic:** Construction and animation of images using Java2D
#### **Objective:** To look at the possibilities of creating images and their animation in Java2D

### **Theoretical information:**

There are two types of computer graphics - raster and vector. 
Rastor graphics represent the image as a set of pixels. 
Vector graphics uses geometric primitives - points, lines, polygons, arcs. Java 2D
provides the ability to work with both raster and vector graphics.

Java 2D is an API for creating two-dimensional images using language Java programming. 
The Java 2D API has the following properties:
- a wide selection of geometric primitives
- definition of intersection of figures, text, images
- quality control of rendering
- printing documents
- uniform rendering model for displays and printers

Java 2D is a powerful enough technology to create powerful and beautiful user interfaces, games, animations, multimedia programs.

### Task options:
Use Java 2D to draw a picture from laboratory work # 1
(option).

Execute:
1. At least 1 standard primitive, and at least 1 figure constructed by
points (broken).
2. At least 1 figure to fill with gradient paint of choice (in this
case color may not coincide with the option from the laboratory
work No. 1).
3. At a sufficient distance from the drawn drawing draw
a rectangular frame within which the animation will take place. Line type
The frame is given by option.
4. Run the animation of the image, optionally. This frame should be
remain static. Interaction with the frame is not required, if not
provided by the option.

Animation types:
- Circular motion counterclockwise
- Обертання навколо центру малюнка за годинниковою стрілкою

### Result:
