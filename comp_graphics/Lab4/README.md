# Lab â„–4
#### **Topic:** Construction of the simplest three-dimensional objects with the help of a library Java3D and their animation
#### **Objective:** 
1. the study of standard Java3D tools for image visualization;
2. studying the means of animation of primitives and complex objects in Java3D.

### Task options:
With the tools provided by the Java3D library, build three-dimensional
object. To do this, take advantage of the basic primitives that will be appropriate
use according to the option: sphere, cone, parallelepiped, cylinder. The object has
consist of 5-15 primitives. 

Variant: *Village House*
